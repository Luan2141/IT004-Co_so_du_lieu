# Student Grades Database Management System

## Project Overview
This project involves creating and managing a comprehensive database to store and analyze student grades from various schools over multiple years. The system is built using **MySQL** for database management and **Python** for application logic and interaction.

## Features
- **Database Design**: 
  - Create a well-structured relational database in MySQL to store:
    - Student information (name, ID, school, grade level, etc.).
    - Subjects and grades for each student.
    - School details and academic year information.
  - Ensure normalization to avoid data redundancy.

- **Data Management**:
  - Add, update, delete, and retrieve student grades.
  - Manage multiple schools and academic years.
  - Support for bulk data import/export (XML).

- **User Interface**:
  - Develop a user-friendly interface using Python 
  - Allow users to interact with the database

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL for storing and managing data.
- **Programming Language**: Python for application development.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `mysql-connector-python` for database interaction.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.

## Objectives
1. Design a scalable database for storing student grades across multiple years and schools.
2. Provide tools for data entry, modification, and retrieval efficiently.
3. Enable analytics and reporting for educators and administrators.
4. Build a user-friendly interface to simplify interaction with the system.
